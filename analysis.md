-   **Associated Author(s):** Charles Sanders Peirce, Ferdinand de
    Saussure.
-   **Rationale:** Peirce and Saussure are the primary founders of
    modern semiotic theory.
-   **Characterization:** Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols as
    fundamental elements of communication. It explores how meaning is
    constructed and understood through sign processes (semiosis) in
    various contexts, including language, images, and gestures.

-   **Rationale:*** *Heidegger coined this term in Being and Time to
    describe human existence. **
-   **Characterization:** *Dasein* is a German term meaning \"being
    there\" or \"presence.\" Introduced by Martin Heidegger, it refers
    to human existence or the experience of being that is aware of and
    questions its own being.

-   **Associated Author(s):** G. W. F. Hegel.
-   **Rationale:*** *Concepts introduced in Hegel\'s Phenomenology of
    Spirit. **
-   **Characterization:** These German terms, introduced by G.W.F.
    Hegel, distinguish between different modes of being. *An-sich-sein*
    (\"being-in-itself\") refers to an object\'s existence independent
    of perception, while *Für-sich-sein* (\"being-for-itself\") refers
    to a being\'s self-awareness or consciousness.
-   **Reference:** Hegel, G. W. F. (1977). *Phenomenology of Spirit*
    (A. V. Miller, Trans.). Oxford University Press. Retrieved from
    https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hegel/

## []{#anchor-38}****2.****5 *****Geist*****

-   **Associated Author(s):** G. W. F. Hegel
-   **Rationale:** Central to Hegel\'s philosophy, where it represents
    the concept of spirit or mind as the driving force of historical and
    cultural development.

    self-developing process that unfolds through history and culture. In
    Hegelian philosophy, *Geist* is the essence of human consciousness
    and freedom, realizing itself through dialectical progression and
    societal institutions. It is both individual and collective,
    signifying the unity of subjective and objective realities.

    between the world as it appears to us and the world as it is in
    itself.
-   **Characterization:** *Ding an Sich* (the thing-in-itself) refers to
    the reality of objects independent of human perception or cognition.
    In Kantian philosophy, it is the unknowable substrate underlying
    phenomena, highlighting the limitations of human understanding.
    While we can experience objects through the categories of human
    thought, their true nature remains inaccessible.

    Smith, Trans.). Macmillan. Retrieved from
    <https://archive.org/details/critiqueofpurer00kantuoft>

## []{#anchor-40}****2.****7 *****Sinnlichkeit*****

-   **Associated Author(s):** Immanuel Kant
-   **Rationale:** Foundational to Kant's theory of knowledge, where it
    represents the faculty of sensory perception as the basis of
    experience.
-   **Characterization:** *Sinnlichkeit* refers to sensibility, the
    human capacity for sensory experience. In Kantian epistemology, it
    forms the first stage of knowledge acquisition, where raw sensory
    data are organized by the mind through categories and intuitions.
    *Sinnlichkeit* bridges the external world and internal cognition,
    enabling the perception of phenomena.
-   **Reference:** Kant, I. (1781). *Critique of Pure Reason* (N. Kemp
    Smith, Trans.). Macmillan. Retrieved from

## []{#anchor-41}****2.****8 *****Zweckmäßigkeit*****

-   **Associated Author(s):** Immanuel Kant
-   **Rationale:** Central to Kant's *Critique of Judgment*, where it is
    used to describe the concept of purposiveness or teleology as an
    organizing principle of understanding.
-   **Characterization:** *Zweckmäßigkeit* refers to the idea of
    purposiveness, the quality of being directed toward an end or goal.
    In Kantian philosophy, it bridges the gap between the natural world
    and human cognition, emphasizing how objects or phenomena appear as
    if designed for a purpose, even in the absence of a clear creator.
    This concept is critical for understanding aesthetic judgments and
    the perception of beauty, as well as its application in existential
    semiotics to describe goal-directedness in meaning-making processes.
-   **Reference:** Kant, I. (1790). *Critique of Judgment* (J. H.
    Bernard, Trans.). Macmillan. Retrieved from

## []{#anchor-67}2.34 Embodiment (in Zemic Context)

-   **Associated Author(s):** Eero Tarasti.
-   **Rationale:** Tarasti\'s concept for materializing abstract values
    in semiotics.
-   **Characterization:** Embodiment in the Zemic context describes the
    way abstract values or norms are materialized in concrete social or

## []{#anchor-68}2.35 Sublimation (in Zemic Context)

-   **Associated Author(s):** Eero Tarasti.
-   **Rationale:** Adapted by Tarasti to describe the transformation of
    values in existential semiotics.
-   **Characterization:** Sublimation within the Zemic framework refers
    to the transformation of concrete, individual actions into abstract,

    experience, while Husserl further developed it as the core of pure
    consciousness, emphasizing its role in intentional acts.
-   **Characterization:** The transcendental ego is the self as a pure
    subject of consciousness, central to Immanuel Kant's and Edmund
    Husserl's theories of self-awareness.

## []{#anchor-70}2.37 Third Semiotic Revolution

-   **Associated Author(s):** Eero Tarasti
-   **Rationale:** Tarasti identified a shift in semiotics where
    existential and phenomenological perspectives were integrated into
    classical semiotic frameworks. This revolution emphasizes the
    dynamic and subjective nature of meaning-making, bridging
    traditional structuralist approaches with humanistic insights.
-   **Characterization:** The third semiotic revolution refers to the
    integration of existential and phenomenological insights into
    classical semiotics, as proposed by Tarasti.
